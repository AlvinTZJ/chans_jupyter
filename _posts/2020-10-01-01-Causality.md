# Causality

## Introduction to Causality

[Causality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality), also referred to as causation, is what connect one process (cause) with another process (effect).

There are common confusion between **association** and **causation**. It is easy to understand the difference by example. Famous example is the relationship between Chocolate and Nobel prize winner. There was study result that the place where the chocolate consumption is high, won more nobel prize. In this case, chocolate consumption affects the the nobel prize winner? Actually, it is not. The truth is that two quantities (chocolate consumption and nobel prize winner) have steadily increased over time due to respective local conditions, which is not related any further. As a result, these two unrelated time trends induce an association. So in this case, we can tell that there is an association between the chocolate consumption in time and the nobel prize winner trend in time. 

We can draw the relationship between the state $X$ and state $Y$.

The mention of association between $X$ and $Y$ can be explained in 4 causal models.

- $X$ causes $Y$
- And $Y$ causes $X$
- There is common cause which occurs state $X$ and state $Y$. (Usually, it is called **confounding**)
- There are many confounding factors which occurs state $X$ and state $Y$.
