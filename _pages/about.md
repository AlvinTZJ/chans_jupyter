Hi! I'm Chanseok. 
Currently, I'm research engineer in LG Electronics. 
My role is to deploy energy-efficient algorithm in commercial/business product(refrigerator, HVAC etc). Also, I have an experience on developing BSP drivers on 5G environment.

I'm very interested in learning something new(AI, Embedded System, Mathematics). Especially, I enjoyed taking MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) when I have free time. Checkout the details of progress on my [github repos](https://github.com/goodboychan)

This website (powered by **[fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages)**) is the storage of my trial and error reports from experience or taking lectures. So it maybe contains inaccurate contents. If you find something, or have a question about contents, just feel free to contect me through [mail](mailto:kcsgoodboy@gmail.com) or comment it in each page (comments are linked to my github with [utteranc.es](https://utteranc.es/))


I also have a companion blog with korean.(talkingaboutme)[https://talkingaboutme.tistory.com/]
