    "## Convolutional Neural Network\n",
    " [Convolutional Neural Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) (CNN for short) is the most widely used for image classification. Previously, we handled image classification problem (Fashion-MNIST) with Multi Layer Perceptron, and we found that works. At that time, the information containing each image is very simple, and definitely classified with several parameters. But if the dataset contains high resolution image and several channels, it may require huge amount of parameters with mlp in image classification. How can we effectively classify the image without huge amount of parameters? And that's why the CNN exists.\n",

    " \n",
    " Generally, it consists of **Convolution layer**, **Pooling layer**, and **Fully-connected layer**. Usually, Convolution layer and Pooling layer is used for feature extraction. Feature extraction means that it extract important features from image for classification, so that all pixels in images is not required. Through these layer, information of data is resampled, and refined, and go to the output node. Fully-connected (also known as FC) is used for classification."

    "In Fashion-MNIST example, the image containing dataset is grayscale. So the range of pixel value is from 0 to 255. But most of real-world image and all the things we see now is colorized. Technically, it can expressed with 3 base color, Red, Green, Blue. The color system which can express these 3 colors are called **RGB**, and each range of pixel value is also from 0 to 255, same as grayscaled pixel.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: There are other color systems like RGBA (Red-Green-Blue-Alpha) or HSV (Hue-Saturation-Value), HSL (Hue-Saturation-Lightness), etc. In this post, we just assume that image has 3 channels (RGB)\n",
    "\n",
    "So In the figure, this image has shape of 32x32 and 3 channels (RGB).\n",
    "\n",
    "And Next one is the filter, which shape has 5x5x3. The number we need to focus on **3**. Filter always extend the full channel of the input volume. So it requires to set same number of channels in input nodes and filters. \n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, filter has same channel with input image. And let's assume the notation of filter, $w$. Next thing we need to do is just slide th filter over the image spatially, and compute dot products, same as MLP operation (This operation is called **convolution**, and it's the reason why this layer is called Convolution layer). Simply speaking, we just focus on the range covered in filter and dot product like this,\n",

One feature map gather from one filter, we can apply several filters in one input image. If we use 6 5x5 filters, we can get 6 separate feature maps. We can stack them into one object, then we get \"new image\" of size 28x28x6.\n",

For example, to extract the edge of object in image, we can apply the *canny edge filer*, and there is edge detection filter named *sobel filter*, and so on. We can bring the concept of filter in CNN here. In short, filter extract the feature like where the edge is, and convolution layer refine its feature.\n",

    "So what parameteter may affect operation in convolution layer? We can introduce three main parameters for convolution layer: stride, zero-padding, and activation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stride** is the size of step that how far to go to the right or the bottom to perform the next convolution.  It is important that it defines the output model's size. Review the formula of calculating the feature map size,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{(\\text{Height of input} - \\text{Height of filter})}{\\text{Stride}} + 1 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can define any size of strides unless its value is smaller than original model size. As we increase the stride, then the size of feature map will be small, and it means that feature will also be small. Think about that the picture is summarized by just a small dot.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Zero-padding** is another factor that affect the convolution layer. The meaning is contained in its name. A few numbers of zeros surrounds the original image, then process the convolution operation. As we can see from previous process, if the layer is deeper and deeper, then the information will be smaller the original one due to the convolution operation. To preserve the size of original image during process, zero-padding is required. If the filter size is $F$x$F$ and stride is 1, then we can also calculate the zero-padding size,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{F - 1}{2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "You may see the **Activation Function** in MLP. It can also apply in the Convolution layer.\n",
