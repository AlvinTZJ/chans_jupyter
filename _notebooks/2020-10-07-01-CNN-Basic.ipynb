    "## Convolutional Neural Network\n",
    " [Convolutional Neural Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) (CNN for short) is the most widely used for image classification. Previously, we handled image classification problem (Fashion-MNIST) with Multi Layer Perceptron, and we found that works. At that time, the information containing each image is very simple, and definitely classified with several parameters. But if the dataset contains high resolution image and several channels, it may require huge amount of parameters with mlp in image classification. How can we effectively classify the image without huge amount of parameters? And that's why the CNN exists.\n",

    " Generally, it consists of **Convolution layer**, **Pooling layer**, and **Fully-connected layer**. Usually, Convolution layer and Pooling layer is used for feature extraction. Feature extraction means that it extract important features from image for classification, so that all pixels in images is not required. Through these layer, information of data is resampled, and refined, and go to the output node. Fully-connected (also known as FC) is used for classification."
